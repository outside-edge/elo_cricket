# Cricket team ratings

Independent ratings of men's international cricket teams. Elo ratings for Tests,
ODIs, and T20Is are updated weekly, with monthly histories available to download.
Current Test ratings are also available from GAM, Stan, Glicko-2, and TrueSkill.
These experimental methods have separate scales, uncertainty estimates, and outputs.

## Run

Install R 4.6.0, then run from the repository root:

```sh
make sync
make check
make update
```

`make sync` restores the dependencies pinned in `renv.lock`. `make update` fetches
match results from ESPNcricinfo and rebuilds the Elo ratings, figures, and
publication through yesterday. Acquisition, preparation, analysis, visualization,
and publication can also run separately; see the [pipeline guide](docs/pipeline.md)
for commands, data coverage, and validation rules.

Inputs live in `data/`, model results in `out/analysis/`, figures in `figs/`,
and published files in `out/release/`. The pipeline uses R, with Stan model
specifications for Bayesian estimation.

To build and check the website, install Quarto 1.10.19 and run `make site`.
Rendering reads the saved publication without fetching data or refitting models.

## Models

Elo updates ratings after each completed match. Draws and ties count as half-results;
abandoned, cancelled, and no-result matches cause no update. The published Elo
model has no venue adjustment or uncertainty intervals.

The experimental models add different accounts of team strength:

- **GAM:** smooth team trajectories, with home advantage varying by country and ground.
- **Stan:** a dynamic TrueSkill-style model with strength uncertainty and venue and time effects on draws.
- **Glicko-2:** ratings with uncertainty and inactivity handling, using `PlayerRatings`.
- **TrueSkill:** Gaussian skill updates with calendar-time uncertainty, using `TrueSkillThroughTime`.

[Current ratings](https://outside-edge.github.io/elo_cricket/docs/models.html)
use all eligible completed Tests through their stated cutoff.
[Reproduction commands](docs/current_models.md) are separate from model evaluation.

The first comparison trains on 1,039 Tests completed before 2024 and forecasts
53 Tests in 2024. This pilot is too small to establish a preferred model.
See the [evaluation scores](out/analysis/models/test/2024-01-01/metrics.csv),
[GAM trajectories](figs/models/test/2024-01-01/gam.png), and
[Stan trajectories](figs/models/test/2024-01-01/stan_dynamic_probit.png).
The [experiment specification](docs/model_experiment.md) gives the assumptions,
validation protocol, and commands to reproduce the fits.
